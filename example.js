//example:

function(input){
    let variable = //adjusts the variable to decimal places or trims it

    //can let variable be turned into an array po or do i need a seperate array po?
    //NO, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SEPERATE ARRAY

    let array = [];
    //IT IS POSSIBLE TO SORT THIS
array.push(variable);
//NO NEED FOR LOOPS UNLESS STATED BY THE PROBLEM
//WHEN DOING LOOPS, USING THE ARRAY NAME OR VARIABLE NAME DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION
//WHEN COMAPRING AND OUTPUTTING FOR ONE VALUE USE "variable"
//HOWEVER IF IT IS MULTIPLE VALUES USE "array"

}
input = "valuesbeinggenerated"
